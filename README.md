# Wrangle_and_Analyze_Data-
A Udacity nano-degree course project
## This is Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Program project.
In this project I'll work on gathering, Assessing and Cleaning data.\n
The data would be from a twitter account (@dog_rates).\n
The goal is to wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. The Twitter archive is great, but it only contains very basic tweet information. Additional gathering, then assessing and cleaning is required for "Wow!"-worthy analyses and visualizations.
